# Python Async Function

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to asynchronous programming in Python. The project explores the use of  and the creation of async coroutines.

## Directory Structure

- **0-basic_async_syntax.py**: Coroutine  that waits for a random delay and returns it.
- **1-concurrent_coroutines.py**: Coroutine  to execute multiple coroutines concurrently and return delays in ascending order.
- **2-measure_runtime.py**: Function  to measure runtime of .
- **3-tasks.py**: Function  that creates an asyncio.Task.
- **4-tasks.py**: Function  based on  using .

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zykeladebrouille/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd python_async_function
   ```

Each script can be tested with the provided main files or by running custom test cases.
