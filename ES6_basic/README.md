# JavaScript ES6 Basics Project

This project explores ES6 features in JavaScript, including new variable declarations, arrow functions, default parameters, and more. It's designed to help you understand and practice modern JavaScript concepts.

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the ES6_basic directory


## Tasks

### 0. Const or let?
- Modify `taskFirst` to use `const`
- Modify `taskNext` to use `let`

**Tip**: Remember, `const` is for values that won't be reassigned, while `let` is for variables that might change.

### 1. Block Scope
- Modify variables in `taskBlock` to avoid overwriting in the conditional block

**Tip**: Consider using `let` instead of `var` to create block-scoped variables.

### 2. Arrow functions
- Rewrite the standard function using ES6 arrow function syntax

**Tip**: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and lexically bind `this`.

### 3. Parameter defaults
- Condense the function using default parameter values

**Tip**: Default parameters allow you to initialize parameters with default values if no value or `undefined` is passed.

### 4. Rest parameter syntax for functions
- Use rest parameter syntax to return the number of arguments

**Tip**: Rest parameters allow you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

### 5. The wonders of spread syntax
- Use spread syntax to concatenate arrays and string characters

**Tip**: Spread syntax allows an iterable to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments/elements are expected.

### 6. Take advantage of template literals
- Use a template literal for the return string

**Tip**: Template literals allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings.

### 7. Object property value shorthand syntax
- Simplify the budget object using shorthand property value syntax

**Tip**: When the property name is the same as the variable name, you can use this shorthand syntax.

### 8. No need to create empty objects before adding properties
- Use ES6 computed property names on the budget object

**Tip**: Computed property names allow you to put an expression in brackets `[]`, which will be computed and used as the property name.

### 9. ES6 method properties
- Rewrite `getFullBudgetObject` using ES6 method properties

**Tip**: ES6 provides a shorter syntax for method definitions in object literals.

### 10. For...of Loops
- Rewrite the function using ES6's for...of operator

**Tip**: `for...of` creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including Array, Map, Set, etc.

### 11. Iterator
- Create a function returning an object with a specific format

**Tip**: Pay attention to the structure of the object you need to return.

### 12. Let's create a report object
- Create a function returning an object with a specific key and method

**Tip**: Remember to use the spread operator when dealing with the `employeesList`.

## General Tips for Beginners

1. **Read the ES6 documentation**: Familiarize yourself with ES6 features on MDN web docs.

2. **Use console.log() liberally**: Print variables and results to understand what's happening in your code.

3. **Practice, practice, practice**: Try to implement each feature in small, separate scripts before tackling the tasks.

4. **Understand the 'why'**: Don't just learn the syntax, understand why these new features were introduced.

5. **Use an ES6-compatible environment**: Ensure you're using a JavaScript environment that supports ES6 features.

6. **Learn to use the debugger**: Debugging tools can help you understand code execution step-by-step.

7. **Write clean, readable code**: Even though you're learning new syntax, focus on writing clear, understandable code.

8. **Don't be afraid to make mistakes**: Errors are part of the learning process. Use them to understand the language better.

Remember, the goal is to understand ES6 concepts, not just to complete the tasks. Take your time to experiment with each new feature you learn.

Good luck with your ES6 Basics project!
